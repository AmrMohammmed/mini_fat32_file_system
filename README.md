# mini_fat_project
This project is an example of mini_Fat, it's a simple version of the real Fat32 system
It seems to handle files and folders (make, copy, delete,rename .....etc) like using the Windows command line on the actual disk
But only inside a virtual disk whose total size is not more than 1m represented by "Try.txt"
