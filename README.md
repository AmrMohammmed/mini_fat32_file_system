# mini_fat_project
This project is a simple version of the real Fat32 system
It seems to handle files and folders (make, copy, delete,rename .....etc) like using the Windows command line on the actual disk
But only inside a virtual disk whose total size is not more than 1MB represented by "Try.txt"
## Note
The virtual disk file exists in this path "\mini_fat32_file_system-main\T2 V2\bin\Debug" under the name of "Try.txt"
also "help.txt" file exists in the same path (help.txt is necessary for the help command to work) 
beside other template files that you can import and show their content to test import command
